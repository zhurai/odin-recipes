# Odin-Recipes

This project was done as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s [Foundations Project:Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) which was a small website that hosts recipes of foods.

I am doing this to refresh my HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge if there were any gaps in my learning before.
